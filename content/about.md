I'm Jama. I flip bits and write emails at [Notion Backups](https://notionbackups.com). Sometimes, I work on [rectangles.app](https://rectangles.app).

If you're curious what I'm up to, find me on my [personal weblog](https://jmstfv.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmstfv), or [Github](https://github.com/jmstfv).

If you have suggestions or want to chat about anything, [shoot me an email](mailto:httpguides@jmstfv.com) or reach out on Twitter. You can also [suggest changes on Github](https://github.com/jmstfv/httpguides).
