The <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> 418 status code means a server refuses to brew a coffee because it's a teapot.

This status code was part of an April fools joke in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP)</a>.

There have been some <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/14644" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussions on removing this status code</a>, but it is likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol#Save_418_movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here to stay</a> for the foreseeable future.
