description: Learn what the HTTP 200 OK status code means and when it is used.
---

The <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> 200 status code means a request was successful.

The server's response will depend on the HTTP method used:

* GET - The resource itself is returned (for example, a web page or a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> response from an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>)
* HEAD - Similar to GET, but it doesn't contain the resource itself, only HTTP headers
* POST - The result of a request (POST method is used to create/alter the resource)

`200 OK` is the most commonly used status code.
